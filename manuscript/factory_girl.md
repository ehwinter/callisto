# FactoryGirl

## Defining factories

```ruby
FactoryGirl.define do

  # Default 
  # It will use the User class
  factory :user do
    first_name "John"
    last_name  "Doe"
    admin false
  end

  # Specifying the class 
  # It will use the User class, instead of Admin class
  factory :admin, class: User do
    first_name "Admin"
    last_name  "User"
    admin      true
  end

end
```

## Building factories

```ruby
# Returns an User instance that's not saved
user = FactoryGirl.build(:user)

# Returns a saved User instance
user = FactoryGirl.create(:user)

# Returns a hash f attributes that can be used to build an User instance
attrs = FactoryGirl.attributes_for(:user)

# Returns an object with all defined attributes stubbed out
stub = FactoryGirl.build_stubbed(:user)

# Passing a block to any of the methods above will yield the return object
FactoryGirl.create(:user) do |user|
  user.posts.create(attributes_for(:post))
end

# Overriding attributes of a factory
user = FactoryGirl.build(:user, first_name: "Joe")
user.first_name
# => "Joe"

# No matter which build strategy is used to override attributes
user = FactoryGirl.create(:user, first_name: "Joe")
user.first_name
# => "Joe"
```

## Lazy Attributes

Some attributes may need values assigned each time an instance is created.

```ruby
# Lazy attributes can be added by passing a block instead of a parameter
factory :user do
  # ...
  activation_code { User.generate_activation_code }
  date_of_birth   { 21.years.ago }
  some_attr       { some_method }
end
```

## Dependent attributes

Attributes can be based on the values of other attributes.

```ruby
factory :user do
  first_name "Joe"
  last_name  "Blow"
  email { "#{first_name}.#{last_name}@example.com".downcase }
end
```

## Associations

```ruby
# If the factory name is the same as the association name, it's simple
factory :post do
  author
end

# You can also specify a different factory or override attributes
factory :post do
  # ...
  association :author, factory: :user, last_name: "Writely"
end

# Builds and saves a User and a Post
post = FactoryGirl.create(:post)
post.new_record?        # => false
post.author.new_record? # => false

# Builds and saves a User, and then builds but does not save a Post
post = FactoryGirl.build(:post)
post.new_record?        # => true
post.author.new_record? # => false
```

## Aliases

Aliases allow to use named associations more easily.

```ruby
factory :user, aliases: [:author, :commenter] do
  first_name    "John"
  last_name     "Doe"
  date_of_birth { 18.years.ago }
end

factory :post do
  # instead of association :author, factory: :user
  author
  title "How to read a book effectively"
  body  "There are five steps involved."
end

factory :comment do
  # instead of association :commenter, factory: :user
  commenter
  body "Great article!"
end

```

## Trait

Trait helps you to remove duplication

```ruby
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :post do
    title 'An awesome post'
    body 'Lorem Ipsum...'

    trait :published do
      status :published
    end

    trait :unpublished do
      status :draft
    end
    
    trait :with_comments do
      after(:create) do |post|
        create_list :comment, 2, todo_item: post
      end
    end
  end
end

# then in your test

let(:post) { create(:post, :published) }

# or even with

let(:post) { create(:post, :published, :with_comments) }
```
