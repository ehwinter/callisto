h2. Cleaning up branches

h4. remove local branches

while on say master, remove local branch scratch
git branch -D scratch

h4. remove branches on remote

Now remove scratch from the remote makalu:
git push makalu :scratch

h4. resynch/prune no longer useful branches 

If you go to another machine scratch will not longer exist on remote makalu so you will have to do this to remove the now deprecated remote. This command actually resynch and prunes all non-existant remote branches in your local repo.

git remote prune makalu # makalu is the name of the remote, could be origin or upstream...

h2. Prune: get rid of useless commits

If you do branch/merge some commits are no longer referenced

git prune
git gc --prune=now
